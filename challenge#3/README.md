# Challange#3

  

We have a nested object, we would like a function that you pass in the object and a key and get back the value. How this is implemented is up to you.

  

> Given an object

```json

{"a":{"b":{"c":"d"}}}

```

> and the key =

`` a/b/c ``

the function to return

```json

d

```

  

  

# Approach- lanaguage used is python.

Define a function that takes two parameters named

> object : the full JSON object
> keys : an Array of keys in the order
